[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"## Camera
* Support for many different Sony Cameras. [See the list](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Supported-Cameras)
* Provides LiveView function if the camera supports it
* Images are downloaded in Sony's native ARW format (this is a N.I.N.A feature) so full meta-data is available
* ISO is controllable via Gain property
* If the exposure time is 30 seconds or below the driver will select the nearest built-in exposure time, otherwise BULB mode will be used

## Focuser
* Support for over 15 different camera-mounted lenses. [See the list](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Supported-Lenses)

*Note*: This addon uses the core (non-ASCOM) files present in the Sony ASCOM driver v1.0.1.17 and later, which must be installed for this addon to start up correctly. You can find the Sony ASCOM driver at [https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/releases](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/releases).

## Support
The best way to get support is via email. You can find my email address by following the *Homepage* link above, or by looking at the bottom of the [ASCOM driver Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Troubleshooting).

For many bugs/problems I'm going to ask you for a driver log file, [here's a link to how you would do that](https://github.com/dougforpres/ASCOMSonyCameraDriver/wiki/Troubleshooting#the-driver-dll-log).
